**Note:** Due to some updates to some packages I am having to update JSUMS120.jl 
and may not work correctly depending on what version of the required packages are being used.

The JSUMS120.jl file is my frontend to the SymPy.jl package to be used in a Pluto.jl notbook. 
It is intended to make it easier for my Applied Calculus students to learn calculus. 

To use this you need to download and save the JSUMS120.jl file in the same directory as where you will save your Pluto notebook. 
Your Pluto notebook has some required code that can be found in the file MS120Template.jl. 
The codeblock of html is not necesary,
but makes the notebook look better (in my opinion).

The file Test_MS200_Pluto.jl runs all the commands in the JSUMS120.jl file to test if it is working correctly.
